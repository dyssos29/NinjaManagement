# NinjaManagement
This web app is comprised of front-end and back-end parts. The front-end is a single web-page built with HTML5, CSS3 and JQuery. It also uses the technologies of Ajax and Moustache.js (logicless template language). The back-end on the other hand is a RESTful web service (API), which is built with JavaEE and also based on the JAX-RS specifications. Its database part is based on JDBC and MySQL. The communication between these two parts is based exlusively on the exchange of JSON messages, according to the REST rules. As such, the front-ent part consumes the web service of the back-end, whose resource is the "Ninja" object and the provided HTTP methods are the GET, POST, PUT and DELETE.

Finally, this web application is deployed on Heroku PaaS and thus live demo is available: [Live Demo at Heroku](https://ninja-management.herokuapp.com)
